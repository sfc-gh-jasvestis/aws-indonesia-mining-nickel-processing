# APJ Nickel Processing - Indonesia RKEF and HPAL Lines

End-to-end processing operations for **24 nickel processing lines across 5 Indonesian sites** (Morowali, Weda Bay, Konawe, Pomalaa, Obi Island) using Snowflake, optionally with AWS: from a live line alarm to a 7-day process-upset risk score, an alarm email and an AI action memo.

## Architecture

A nickel processing pipeline built on **Snowflake** (Dynamic Tables, Snowflake ML, Cortex Search, Cortex Agent, Cortex AI_COMPLETE, SPCS) and, in the full build, **AWS** (IoT Core, S3, Bedrock Claude, QuickSight + Amazon Q). Line sensor telemetry lands in `RAW.LIVE_TELEMETRY`. Dynamic tables curate 90 days of line-day history: nickel recovery, energy per dry tonne, process upsets and availability. Snowflake ML scores 7-day upset risk per line, forecasts network-wide nickel recovery and flags setpoint deviation anomalies. A Cortex Agent answers questions with SOP citations, and an LLM drafts the processing action memo.

Interactive diagrams (hover for object names): [Snowflake only](docs/architecture-snowflake.html) | [AWS + Snowflake](docs/architecture-aws.html). The app shows both on its Architecture & Data tab, the current build first. Regenerate them with `python3 docs/build_architecture.py`.

The Snowflake-only build drops the AWS subgraph: `APP.SIMULATE_TELEMETRY` writes to `RAW.LIVE_TELEMETRY`, and the app calls Cortex `AI_COMPLETE` instead of the Bedrock UDF.

## Snowflake Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Dynamic Tables | `CURATED.KPI_SUMMARY`, `PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY`, `UPSET_CAUSES`, `TREND_ANALYSIS` from the RAW tables |
| Snowflake ML | CLASSIFICATION 7-day process-upset risk (`ML.UPSET_RISK_SCORES`), 14-day nickel-recovery FORECAST, setpoint deviation ANOMALY_DETECTION |
| Cortex Search | 18 synthetic upset-response SOPs (one per process stage and cause) in `SEARCH.PROCESS_SOP_SEARCH` |
| Semantic View | `APP.PROCESS_ANALYTICS` over lines, upset causes, daily recovery and risk |
| Cortex Agent | `APP.PROCESS_AGENT`: Cortex Analyst over the semantic view plus Cortex Search for SOP citations |
| Cortex AI | `AI_COMPLETE('claude-sonnet-4-5')` for grounded answers, and for the action memo in the Snowflake-only build |
| Alerts + Tasks | `APP.LIVE_ALARM_ALERT` logs ALARM readings and sends email; task graph `TASK_REFRESH_CURATED`, then `TASK_RESCORE_RISK` |
| Snowpark Container Services | Next.js app `APP.ID_NICKEL_PROC_APP` with 6 tabs: Executive Cockpit, Predictive, Line Health, Live IoT, Ask AI, Architecture & Data |
| Snowpipe | `RAW.LIVE_TELEMETRY_PIPE` AUTO_INGEST from S3 (AWS build only) |

## AWS Services

Used only in the AWS + Snowflake build.

| Service | Role in Demo |
|---------|-------------|
| AWS IoT Core | Receives simulated line sensor telemetry (setpoint deviation, shell temperature). A topic rule writes each message to S3 |
| Amazon S3 | Landing bucket. An event notification goes to the Snowpipe SQS queue |
| Amazon Bedrock | Claude Sonnet 4.5 writes the action memo, called from Snowflake through an external-access UDF |
| Amazon QuickSight | DIRECT_QUERY executive dashboard over Snowflake (daily nickel recovery, upsets by line, upset risk) |
| Amazon Q | Natural-language questions over the QuickSight topic `id-nickel-proc-topic` |
| AWS IAM | Least-privilege roles for S3, IoT and Bedrock |

## Personas

These personas are fictional.

| Persona | Role | Key Questions |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Ir. Rina Wulandari** | VP Processing Operations | "Which site has the lowest nickel recovery?" "Which upset causes cost us the most nickel?" |
| **Budi Santoso** | Process Metallurgist | "Which lines are high upset risk this week, and which SOP applies?" |

## Data

All data is synthetic and seeded, so every rebuild reproduces it. Plants, lines and operators are fictional; the five sites are real Indonesian nickel processing locations, and no figure describes a real operation.

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| RAW.LINES | 24 | Process lines across 5 sites and 5 stages (Rotary Kiln, Electric Furnace, Autoclave, CCD Circuit, MHP Precipitation) |
| RAW.LINE_DAILY | 2,160 | Daily line observations over 90 days: dry ore feed, nickel in feed and recovered, energy, upsets, root cause, PM, setpoint deviation and shell temperature |
| RAW.CRITICAL_SPARES | 24 | Required and on-hand critical spares per line |
| SEARCH.PROCESS_DOCS | 18 | Synthetic upset-response SOPs indexed for Cortex Search |
| RAW.LIVE_TELEMETRY | Grows during the demo | Live readings from IoT Core (AWS build) or `APP.SIMULATE_TELEMETRY` (Snowflake-only build) |
| ML.UPSET_RISK_SCORES | 24 | 7-day process-upset probability and risk band per line |

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN access, and Cortex AI enabled (AI_COMPLETE, Search, Agent).
- An X-Small warehouse with auto-suspend at or below 120 s, and an existing SPCS compute pool.
- Python 3.11+, `snowflake-connector-python`, Node.js 22+, Docker and the `snow` CLI.
- App image: run `snow spcs image-registry login`, then build and push `id-nickel-proc-app:v1` to the database's `APP.IMAGES` repository (see the header of `snowflake/07_deploy_app.sql`).
- AWS build only: `boto3`, AWS credentials for the target account (us-west-2) with Bedrock access, and QuickSight Enterprise.

### SPCS App
```
<DATABASE>.APP.ID_NICKEL_PROC_APP
```

### Tests
```bash
python -m pytest aws snowflake quicksight
```

For a local run, put `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`, `SNOWFLAKE_AUTHENTICATOR=PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN` and `DEMO_PLATFORM` in the environment, then run `npm --prefix app run build && npm --prefix app start`.

## Build Modes

Both modes share the same core. They differ in three places, and the app's `DEMO_PLATFORM` setting (in its SPCS spec) switches the memo provider and the Live IoT tab.

| Layer | Snowflake Only | Full AWS + Snowflake |
|---|---|---|
| Live telemetry | `CALL APP.SIMULATE_TELEMETRY(n)` inserts simulated readings into `RAW.LIVE_TELEMETRY`. This simulates a sensor feed; it is not Snowpipe Streaming | `aws/publish_telemetry.py` to AWS IoT Core, then S3, SQS and Snowpipe AUTO_INGEST |
| Action memo | Cortex `AI_COMPLETE('claude-sonnet-4-5')` | Amazon Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4.5 through `APP.BEDROCK_GENERATE` |
| BI and natural-language questions | The SPCS app is the dashboard; questions go to the Cortex Agent | Also a QuickSight dashboard and an Amazon Q topic |
| App setting | `DEMO_PLATFORM: snowflake` | `DEMO_PLATFORM: aws` |

### Snowflake Only

```bash
# 1. Core data and dynamic tables (guarded: new isolated database only)
python snowflake/run_core.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_SNOWFLAKE --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 2. Native telemetry, ML, search, semantic view, agent, alert and task graph
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_SNOWFLAKE --platform snowflake --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com
# 3. App on SPCS with DEMO_PLATFORM=snowflake (push the image first)
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_SNOWFLAKE --platform snowflake --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com --files 07_deploy_app.sql --compute-pool <COMPUTE_POOL>
```

During the demo:
- Run `CALL APP.SIMULATE_TELEMETRY(20)` to add live readings. For a continuous feed, run `ALTER TASK APP.TASK_SIMULATE_TELEMETRY RESUME`, and `SUSPEND` it afterwards.
- Run `EXECUTE ALERT APP.LIVE_ALARM_ALERT` to raise the alarm email.
- Run `EXECUTE TASK APP.TASK_REFRESH_CURATED` to refresh the curated tables and rescore risk.

Afterwards, drop the database or run `ALTER SERVICE APP.ID_NICKEL_PROC_APP SUSPEND`.

### Full AWS + Snowflake

```bash
# 1. Core data and dynamic tables (guarded: new isolated database only)
python snowflake/run_core.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 2. AWS ingestion and Bedrock (dry run first, then --apply)
python aws/setup_aws.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 3. ML, search, semantic view, agent, alert and task graph
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --platform aws --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com
# 4. App on SPCS with DEMO_PLATFORM=aws (push the image first)
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --platform aws --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com --files 07_deploy_app.sql --compute-pool <COMPUTE_POOL>
# 5. QuickSight dashboard and Q topic (needs an existing Snowflake data source)
python quicksight/build_dashboards.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --principal-arn <QUICKSIGHT_USER_ARN> --data-source-arn <DATA_SOURCE_ARN> --prefix id-nickel-proc --apply --update --with-topic
```

QuickSight objects must be shared with the QuickSight user who signs in (`--principal-arn`); otherwise the console shows nothing.

During the demo:
- Run `python aws/publish_telemetry.py --count 20` to send live readings.
- Run `EXECUTE ALERT APP.LIVE_ALARM_ALERT` to raise the alarm email.
- Run `EXECUTE TASK APP.TASK_REFRESH_CURATED` to refresh the curated tables and rescore risk.

Afterwards, `python aws/teardown_aws.py --database INDONESIA_NICKEL_PROCESS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply` removes the AWS resources and the account-level Bedrock external-access and S3 storage integrations. It leaves the email integration `ID_NICKEL_PROC_EMAIL_INT`, which the Snowflake-only build also uses.

## Business Impact

Industry research:
- **Indonesia** produced an estimated 2,200,000 metric tons of nickel (mine production, nickel content) in 2024, out of a rounded world total of 3,700,000 tons -- [USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025, Nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-nickel.pdf)
- **Predictive maintenance**, on average, increases productivity by 25%, reduces breakdowns by 70% and lowers maintenance costs by 25% -- [Deloitte Analytics Institute, Predictive Maintenance position paper](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone2/de/de/docs/about/2024/Deloitte_Predictive-Maintenance_PositionPaper.pdf)

## Key Demo Numbers

These figures are synthetic and come from the seeded demo data. Forecast and anomaly figures can shift slightly with the build day.

- **24 lines**, 2,160 line-days over 90 days, across 5 sites and 5 process stages
- **Nickel recovery 92.9%**; per-line recovery ranges from 90.2% to 95.2%, and Pomalaa is the lowest site at 92.0%
- **133 process upsets** across 14 root causes; kiln ring build-up costs the most nickel (53.6 t not recovered)
- **Energy intensity 0.140 MWh per dry tonne** over 3,471,929 dry tonnes of ore; line availability 99.2%
- **Upset-risk model** out-of-time holdout: precision 0.58, recall 0.38 at a 0.5 threshold, against a 0.31 base rate. Six lines are high risk; the top line is PL-0014, at 97.7%
- **14-day nickel-recovery forecast** with prediction intervals; **18 of 384** line-days flagged as setpoint deviation anomalies
- **18 SOPs** indexed for Cortex Search and cited by ID in agent answers
